# BrawlRanker

Link to Deployed App: https://lol-ranker.vercel.app/

Got bored.
Made this thing. 
Rank how cringe different super smash bros brawl characters are. 
Was pretty fun. Will fix up the ui/ux later. the global tierlist button is clickable which I have been told is not obvious. Enjoy!

The main Technologies I used for the project are:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

It was deployed with Vercel and created using the Create_t3_app library
